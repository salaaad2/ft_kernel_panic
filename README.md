# ft_kernel_panic

Kernel Panic is a cool function to stress test OSs, the function is a simple way to allocate memory until the OS decides to kill the program.
This function has been tested on void linux, which simply stops it after some time.


## How do I test it ?

simply copy **kernel_panic.c** somewhere, compile it, then run it, simple.
